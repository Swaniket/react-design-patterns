# React Design Patterns

The following patterns are covered:

1. **Layout Components:** Layout components are components in react whose primary concern is helping us to arrange other components that we create on the page.

   - Split Screen Components
   - Regular List Component
   - Numbered List Component
   - Modal Component

2. **Container Components:** Container components are the react components that take care of all the data loading & other data management for their child components.

   - User Loader Component
   - Current User Loader Component
   - Data Source Component
   - Resource Loader Component

3. **Controlled and Uncontrolled Components:** Uncontrolled components itself keeps track of their internal states and release data only when some event occurs, where are for Controlled components, the parent component keeps track of the data and all state is passed in as props.

   - Forms
   - Modals
   - Onboarding flow

4. **Higher Order Components:** These are functions that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component that wraps the original component, passing in some new data or behavior.

   - Print Props
   - withUser
   - withEditableUser
   - withEditableResource

5. **Custom Hooks:** Hooks are basically reusable functions that can be used by various components

   - useUser
   - UseCurrentUser
   - useDatasource
   - useResource

6. **Functional Programming with React:** Several functional programming concepts in react
   - Recursive Components
   - Composition
   - Partially Apply
